# Law Review Abbreviations

This is a repo devoted to listing abbreviations of law journals. The process of citing journals is painstaking and many times it is difficult to find the exact abbreviation for a journal. We have developed this repo in that light to simplify research and citation.

The information contained in this repo is open for everyone. However, each individual journal may have their own policies for using their content. We strongly recommend referring to each journal's guidelines for further information on their policies.
