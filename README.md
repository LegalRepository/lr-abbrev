# Law Review Abbreviations

This is a repo devoted to listing abbreviations of law journals. The process of citing journals is painstaking and many times it is difficult to find the exact abbreviation for a journal. We have developed this repo in that light to simplify research and citation.

The information contained in this repo is open for everyone. However, each individual journal may have their own policies for using their content. We strongly recommend referring to each journal's guidelines for further information on their policies.

## How to Use this Information

We recommend checking the official page for a list of journal abbreviations available at our [official page](https://abbreviation.legalrepository.org/).

For **advanced users**, you can check our official raw CSV file containing the list of abbreviations.

## Contribution

Contributing to this repo is permitted but **encouraged**. In particular, we recommend that journals, citation standard maintainers, and academicians take an active participation to recommend better standards for this information.

If any editor or member of a journal wishes to make a modification to the list please follow the steps below to update the document. Alternatively, if you require any assistance please feel free to drop a line to our [issues page](/../../issues/).
