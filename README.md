# Law Review Abbreviations

This is a repo devoted to listing abbreviations of law journals. The process of citing journals is painstaking and many times it is difficult to find the exact abbreviation for a journal. We have developed this repo in that light to simplify research and citation.

The information contained in this repo is open for everyone. However, each individual journal may have their own policies for using their content. We strongly recommend referring to each journal's guidelines for further information on their policies.

## How to Use this Information

We recommend checking the official page for a list of journal abbreviations available at our [official page](https://abbreviation.legalrepository.org/).

For **advanced users**, you can check our official raw CSV file containing the list of abbreviations.

## Contribution

Contributing to this repo is permitted but **encouraged**. In particular, we recommend that journals, citation standard maintainers, and academicians take an active participation to recommend better standards for this information.

If any editor or member of a journal wishes to make a modification to the list please follow the steps below to update the document. Alternatively, if you require any assistance please feel free to drop a line to our [issues page](/../../issues/).

## Instructions for Updating

To update the information contained within this repo please follow these steps.

### Fork the Repo

This part is easy. Simply click the fork icon and let all of the hard work happen by itself.

### Go to your Repo

All you need to do is make changes to the CSV file. You can simply click the link and reach the document.

### Insert your Data

Then you need to make an update to the document. You essentially need to have three pieces of information ready â€“ the name of the journal, its abbreviation, and its URL (to its website).

You then need to arrange the information as follows:
```
Journal Name, Abbreviation, URL
```

Please note that the `,` are very important and without them it would not be possible to complete the entry.

Place your journal's information between those entries that alphabetically proceed and succeed your journal.

Simply complete by committing your data.

### Create a Push Request

With that create a push request and we will take care of the rest.

Thank you for contributing!
